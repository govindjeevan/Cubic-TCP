# Cubic-TCP
CUBIC is the default TCP used in the Linux kernel and recently, a patch has been made available for CUBIC implementation in ns-3. CUBIC is an optimized congestion control for high bandwidth high latency networks (also known as Long Fat Networks). In this project, the aim is to validate ns-3 CUBIC implementation by comparing the results obtained from it to those obtained by simulating Linux CUBIC. Required experience: C and C++ Bonus experience: Knowledge of CUBIC and TCP implementation in ns-3 Difficulty: Moderate Recommended Reading: ● Direct Code Execution (Link: https://www.nsnam.org/overview/projects/direct-code-execution/) ● Linux kernel code (Link: https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v4.4/source/net/ipv4/tcp_cubic.c) ● CUBIC Paper (Link: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1400105)
